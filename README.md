# mnist-cpp

I wanted to make a neural network in c++ and what better way than starting with classic mnist problem! Unfortunatley it didn't came out as fast as I expected it takes program about 120 seconds to adjust to each epoch (60000 data points) which is not ideal. It took 30 seconds for the python version which is available on this profile.Since everyone says c++ neural networks are faster I am probably doing something inefficiently ,if you know what please inform me on sadrat83@gmail.com

you should first download and install Eigen library and download mnist's .csv files from https://github.com/pjreddie/mnist-csv-png.
